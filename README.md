# Cross-platform GPU fluid simulation

### [Demo](http://haxiomic.github.io/GPU-Fluid-Experiments/html5/)

This repo is a little old and dusty and likely doesn't build with the latest tools, If you're looking for a version with working build instructions check out [this fork: BathBombFluidDynamics](https://github.com/ollyc2015/BathBombFluidDynamics) by [Oliver Curtis](https://github.com/ollyc2015) which adds some interesting effects.

I'm currently working on a rewrite so watch this space :)
